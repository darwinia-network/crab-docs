# Using Waffle & Mars to Deploy to Pangolin

## Introduction

[Waffle](https://getwaffle.io/) is a library for compiling and testing smart contracts, and [Mars](https://github.com/EthWorks/Mars) is a deployment manager. Together, Waffle and Mars can be used to write, compile, test, and deploy Ethereum smart contracts. Since Darwinia is Ethereum compatible, Waffle and Mars can be used to deploy smart contracts to a Darwinia development node or the Pangolin.

Waffle uses minimal dependencies, has syntax that is easy to learn and extend, and provides fast execution times when compiling and testing smart contracts. Furthermore, it is [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) compatible and uses [Chai matchers](https://ethereum-waffle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/matchers.html) to make tests easy to read and write.

Mars provides a simple, TypeScript compatible framework for creating advanced deployment scripts and staying in sync with state changes. Mars focuses on infrastructure-as-code, allowing developers to specify how their smart contracts should be deployed and then using those specifications to automatically handle state changes and deployments.

In this guide, you'll be creating a TypeScript project to write, compile, and test a smart contract using Waffle, then deploy it on to the Pangolin using Mars.

## Checking Prerequisites

import InstallNodeJs from '/snippets/text/common/install-nodejs.md';

<InstallNodeJs name="installNodeJs"/>

As of writing of this guide, the versions used were 16.0.0 and 7.10.0, respectively.

Waffle and Mars can be used with a locally running Darwinia development node, but for the purposes of this guide, you will be deploying to Pangolin. Therefore, you will need a funded account for development.

import DevAccount from '/snippets/text/metamask-local/dev-account.md';

<DevAccount name="devAccount" />

Once you've created an account you'll need to export the private key to be used in this guide. Before moving on, ensure your account has funds and, if needed, get `PRING` tokens from the [faucet](../../get-started/darwinia-pangolin/#get-tokens).

## Create a TypeScript Project with Waffle & Mars

To get started, you'll create a TypeScript project and install and configure a few dependencies.

1. Create the project directory and change to it:
```
mkdir waffle-mars && cd waffle-mars
```

2. Initialize the project. Which will create a `package.json` in the directory:
```
npm init -y
```

3. Install the following dependencies:
```
npm install ethereum-waffle ethereum-mars ethers \
@openzeppelin/contracts typescript ts-node chai \
@types/chai mocha @types/mocha
```

- [Waffle](https://github.com/EthWorks/Waffle) - for writing, compiling, and testing smart contracts
- [Mars](https://github.com/EthWorks/Mars) - for deploying smart contracts to Pangolin
- [Ethers](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/) - for interacting with Pangolin's Ethereum API
- [OpenZeppelin Contracts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts) - the contract you'll be creating will use OpenZeppelin's ERC20 base implementation
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) - the project will be a TypeScript project
- [TS Node](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node) - for executing the deployment script you'll create later in this guide
- [Chai](https://github.com/chaijs/chai) - an assertion library used alongside Waffle for writing tests
- [@types/chai](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/HEAD/types/chai) - contains the type definitions for chai
- [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) - a testing framework for writing tests alongside Waffle
- [@types/mocha](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/HEAD/types/mocha) - contains the type definitions for mocha

4. Create a [TypeScript configuration](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html) file:
```
touch tsconfig.json
```

5. Add a basic TypeScript configuration:
```
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "target": "ES2019",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "module": "CommonJS",
    "composite": true,
    "sourceMap": true,
    "declaration": true,
    "noEmit": true
  }
}
```

Now, you should have a basic TypeScript project with the necessary dependencies to get started building with Waffle and Mars.
## Add a Contract

For this guide, you will create an ERC-20 contract that mints a specified amount of tokens to the contract creator. It's based on the Open Zeppelin ERC-20 template.

1. Create a directory to store your contracts and a file for the smart contract:
```
mkdir contracts && cd contracts && touch MyToken.sol
```

2. Add the following contract to MyToken.sol:
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract MyToken is ERC20 {
    constructor() ERC20("MyToken", "MYTOK") {}

    function initialize(uint initialSupply) public {
      _mint(msg.sender, initialSupply);
    }
}
```

In this contract, you are creating an ERC20 token called MyToken with the symbol MYTOK, that allows you, as the contract creator, to mint as many MYTOKs as desired.

## Use Waffle to Compile and Test

### Compile with Waffle

Now that you have written a smart contract, the next step is to use Waffle to compile it. Before diving into compiling your contract, you will need to configure Waffle.

1. Go back to the root project directory and create a `waffle.json` file to configure Waffle:
```
cd .. && touch waffle.json
```

2. Edit the `waffle.json` to specify compiler configurations, the directory containing your contracts, and more. For this example, we'll use `solcjs` and the Solidity version you used for the contract, which is `0.8.7`:
```json
{
  "compilerType": "solcjs", // Specifies compiler to use
  "compilerVersion": "0.8.7", // Specifies version of the compiler
  "compilerOptions": {
    "optimizer": { // Optional optimizer settings
      "enabled": true, // Enable optimizer
      "runs": 20000 // Optimize how many times you want to run the code
    }
  },
  "sourceDirectory": "./contracts", // Path to directory containing smart contracts
  "outputDirectory": "./build", // Path to directory where Waffle saves compiler output
  "typechainEnabled": true // Enable typed artifact generation
}
```

3. Add a script to run Waffle in the `package.json`:
```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "waffle"
},
```

That is all you need to do to configure Waffle, now you're all set to compile the `MyToken` contract using the `build` script:

```
npm run build
```

```
$ waffle-mars npm run build

> waffle-mars@1.0.0 build
> waffle
```

After compiling your contracts, Waffle stores the JSON output in the `build` directory. The contract in this guide is based on Open Zeppelin's ERC-20 template, so relevant ERC-20 JSON files will appear in the `build` directory too.

### Test with Waffle

Before deploying your contract and sending it off into the wild, you should test it first. Waffle provides an advanced testing framework and has plenty of tools to help you with testing.

You'll be running tests against the Pangolin TestNet and will need the corresponding RPC URL to connect to it: `https://pangolin-rpc.darwinia.network`. Since you will be running tests against the TestNet, it might take a couple minutes to run all of the tests.

1. Create a directory to contain your tests and a file to test your `MyToken` contract:
```
mkdir test && cd test && touch MyToken.test.ts
```

2. Open the `MyToken.test.ts` file and setup your test file to use Waffle's Solidity plugin and use Ethers custom JSON-RPC provider to connect to Pangolin:
```typescript
import { use, expect } from 'chai';
import { Provider } from '@ethersproject/providers';
import { solidity } from 'ethereum-waffle';
import { ethers, Wallet } from 'ethers';
import { MyToken, MyTokenFactory } from '../build/types';

// Tell Chai to use Waffle's Solidity plugin
use(solidity);

describe ('MyToken', () => {
  // Use custom provider to connect to Pangolin
  let provider: Provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('https://pangolin-rpc.darwinia.network');
  let wallet: Wallet;
  let walletTo: Wallet;
  let token: MyToken;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    // Logic for setting up the wallet and deploying MyToken will go here
  });

  // Tests will go here
})
```

3. Before each test is run, you'll want to create wallets and connect them to the provider, use the wallets to deploy an instance of the `MyToken` contract, and then call the `initialize` function once with an initial supply of 10 tokens:
```typescript
  beforeEach(async () => {
    const PRIVATE_KEY = '<insert-your-private-key-here>'
    // Create a wallet instance using your private key & connect it to the provider
    wallet = new Wallet(PRIVATE_KEY).connect(provider);

    // Create a random account to transfer tokens to & connect it to the provider
    walletTo = Wallet.createRandom().connect(provider);

    // Use your wallet to deploy the MyToken contract
    token = await new MyTokenFactory(wallet).deploy();

    // Mint 10 tokens to the contract owner, which is you
    let contractTransaction = await token.initialize(10);

    // Wait until the transaction is confirmed before running tests
    await contractTransaction.wait();
  });
```

4. Now you can create your first test. The first test will check your initial balance to ensure you received the initial supply of 10 tokens. However, to follow good testing practices, write a failing test first:
```typescript
it('Mints the correct initial balance', async () => {
  expect(await token.balanceOf(wallet.address)).to.equal(1); // This should fail
});
```

5. Before you can run your first test, you'll need to go back to the root direction and add a `.mocharc.json` Mocha configuration file:
```
cd .. && touch .mocharc.json
```

6. Now edit the `.mocharc.json` file to configure Mocha:
```json
{
  "require": "ts-node/register/transpile-only", // Use ts-node to transpile the code for tests
  "timeout": 600000, // Set timeout to 10 minutes
  "extension": "test.ts" // Specify extension for test files
}
```

7. You'll also need to add a script in the `package.json` to run your tests:
```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "waffle",
  "test": "mocha"
},
```

8. You're all set to run the tests, simply use the `test` script you just created and run:
```
npm run test
```
Please note that it could take a few minutes to process because the tests are running against Pangolin, but if all worked as expected, you should have one failing test.

9. Next, you can go back and edit the test to check for 10 tokens:
```typescript
it('Mints the correct initial balance', async () => {
  expect(await token.balanceOf(wallet.address)).to.equal(10); // This should pass
});
```
10. If you run the tests again, you should now see one passing test:
```
npm run test
```

11. You've tested the ability to mint tokens, next you'll test the ability to transfer the minted tokens. If you want to write a failing test first again that is up to, however the final test should look like this:
```typescript
it('Should transfer the correct amount of tokens to the destination account', async () => {
  // Send the destination wallet 7 tokens
  await (await token.transfer(walletTo.address, 7)).wait();

  // Expect the destination wallet to have received the 7 tokens
  expect(await token.balanceOf(walletTo.address)).to.equal(7);
});
```

Congratulations, you should now have two passing tests! Altogether, your test file should look like this:
```typescript
import { use, expect } from 'chai';
import { Provider } from '@ethersproject/providers';
import { solidity } from 'ethereum-waffle';
import { ethers, Wallet } from 'ethers';
import { MyToken, MyTokenFactory } from '../build/types';

use(solidity);

describe ('MyToken', () => {
  let provider: Provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('https://pangolin-rpc.darwinia.network');
  let wallet: Wallet;
  let walletTo: Wallet;
  let token: MyToken;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    const PRIVATE_KEY = '<insert-your-private-key-here>'
    wallet = new Wallet(PRIVATE_KEY).connect(provider);
    walletTo = Wallet.createRandom().connect(provider);
    token = await new MyTokenFactory(wallet).deploy();
    let contractTransaction = await token.initialize(10);
    await contractTransaction.wait();
  });

  it('Mints the correct initial balance', async () => {
    expect(await token.balanceOf(wallet.address)).to.equal(10);
  });

  it('Should transfer the correct amount of tokens to the destination account', async () => {
    await (await token.transfer(walletTo.address, 7)).wait();
    expect(await token.balanceOf(walletTo.address)).to.equal(7);
  });
})
```

If you want to write more tests on your own, you could consider testing transfers from accounts without any funds or transfers from accounts without enough funds.

## Use Mars to Deploy to Pangolin

After you compile your contracts and before deployment, you will have to generate contract artifacts for Mars. Mars uses the contract artifacts for typechecks in deployments. Then you'll need to create a deployment script and deploy the `MyToken` smart contract.

Remember, you will be deploying to Pangolin and will need to use the TestNet RPC URL: `https://pangolin-rpc.darwinia.network`.

The deployment will be broken up into three sections: [generate artifacts](#generate-artifacts), [create a deployment script](#create-a-deployment-script), and [deploy with Mars](#deploy-with-mars).

### Generate Artifacts

Artifacts need to be generated for Mars so that typechecks are enabled within deployment scripts.

1. Update existing script to run Waffle in the `package.json` to include Mars:
```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "waffle && mars",
  "test": "mocha"
},
```

2. Generate the artifacts and create the `artifacts.ts` file needed for deployments:
```
npm run build
```

```
$ waffle-mars npm run build

> waffle-mars@1.0.0 build
> waffle && mars
```

If you open the `build` directory, you should now see an `artifacts.ts` file containing the artifact data needed for deployments. To continue on with the deployment process, you'll need to write a deployment script. The deployment script will be used to tell Mars which contract to deploy, to what network, and which account is to be used to trigger the deployment.

### Create a Deployment Script

Now you need to configure the deployment for the `MyToken` contract to the Pangolin TestNet.

In this step, you'll create the deployment script which will define how the contract should be deployed. Mars offers a `deploy` function that you can pass options to such as the private key of the account to deploy the contract, the network to deploy to, and more. Inside of the `deploy` function is where the contracts to be deployed are defined. Mars has a `contract` function that accepts the `name`, `artifact`, and `constructorArgs`. This function will be used to deploy the `MyToken` contract with an initial supply of 10 MYTOKs.


1. Create a `src` directory to contain your deployment scripts and create the script to deploy the `MyToken` contract:
```
mkdir src && cd src && touch deploy.ts
```

2. In `deploy.ts`, use Mars' `deploy` function to create a script to deploy to Pangolin using your account's private key:
```javascript
import { deploy } from 'ethereum-mars';

const privateKey = "<insert-your-private-key-here>";
deploy({network: 'https://pangolin-rpc.darwinia.network', privateKey},(deployer) => {
  // Deployment logic will go here
});
```

3. Set up the `deploy` function to deploy the `MyToken` contract created in the previous steps:
```javascript
import { deploy, contract } from 'ethereum-mars';
import { MyToken } from '../build/artifacts';

const privateKey = "<insert-your-private-key-here>";
deploy({network: 'https://pangolin-rpc.darwinia.network', privateKey}, () => {
  contract('myToken', MyToken);
});
```

4. Add a deploy script to the `scripts` object in the `package.json`:
```json
  "scripts": {
    "build": "waffle && mars",
    "test": "mocha",
    "deploy": "ts-node src/deploy.ts"
  },
```

So far, you should have created a deployment script in `deploy.ts` that will deploy the `MyToken` contract to Pangolin, and added the ability to easily call the script and deploy the contract.

### Deploy with Mars

You've configured the deployment, now it's time to actually deploy to Pangolin.

1. Deploy the contract using the script you just created:
```
npm run deploy
```

2. In your Terminal, Mars will prompt you to press `ENTER` to send your transaction:
![Mars confirm deployment](../../../assets/crab-smart-chain/builders/interact/waffle-mars.png)

If successful, you should see details about your transaction including it's hash, the block it was included in, and it's address.

```
$ waffle-mars npm run deploy


> waffle-mars@1.0.0 deploy
> ts-node src/deploy.ts

Transaction: Deploy myToken
  Fee: $19.24, Ξ0.006553245235595322

  Block: 686677
  Address: 0x9e41aa68a1e59b049A13D14281A9d39197F30036
```

Congratulations! You've deployed a contract to Pangolin using Waffle and Mars!
