On the Crab chain, the CRAB tokens work as native token. This means that a user can pay gas with CRAB as well as send CRAB to other accounts the same way as they use ETH to pay gas fees on Ethereum and send ETH to others.

- **Step 2: Transfer the CRAB tokens from the substrate address to the smart address**
