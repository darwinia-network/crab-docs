With the DVM smart contract solution, smart contract projects in the ethereum ecosystem can be easily migrated to the Crab Network. To encourage more community developers to build applications on DVM, Darwinia launched the [Grant Program](https://github.com/darwinia-network/collaboration/blob/master/grant/README.md) and [Bounty Program](https://github.com/darwinia-network/collaboration/blob/master/bounty/README.md).

Projects built on DVM:

- [Subswap](https://subswap.pro/#/swap)：AMM decentralized trading platform
- [Evolution Land](https://github.com/evolutionlandorg/land)： Evolutionary Land Game
