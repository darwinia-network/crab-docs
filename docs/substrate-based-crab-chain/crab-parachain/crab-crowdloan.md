## Crab Crowdloan FAQs

### When will the tokens be distributed?

Thanks to all contributors for your support! Crab Network has won the 22nd Kusama parachain slot, **after Crab Network is successfully connected to Kusama (#block 11491800)**, 10% CRAB and CKTON will be immediately released, meanwhile, the Metaverse NFT Package will be released. And the other 90% CRAB rewards will be linearly released within 44 weeks.

### Do I need to claim my tokens (CRAB+CKTON)?

No. The **CRAB and CKTON** rewards will be distributed to the Substrate-Based Crab Chain address associated with the Kusama address you used to contribute. In other words, you also don’t need to create a Crab account to receive your tokens.

### How can I get my Metaverse NFT Package?

As long as your contribution share is **greater or equal to 1 KSM during the whole crowdloan(third-party exchanges or PLO aggregators are not eligible)**, you can get an Evolution Land Metaverse NFT Package. **After Crab Network is successfully connected to Kusama(#block 11491800)**, you can claim this reward on [Crab PLO page](https://crab.network/plo_contribute), and the reward distribution and claim details will be announced. Please stay tuned.
