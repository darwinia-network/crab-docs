## CKTON

CKTON is essentially a derivative token of CRAB, which encourages long-term lock and commitment. CRAB staking participants can lock CRAB for 1~36 months and get CKTON as rewards, compensating for the liquidity loss.

- The initial supply of CKTON is 0, and it can only be obtained by locking CRAB. There is no other distribution channel. CKTON has no impact on the function of CRAB.
- Users can lock a certain amount of CRAB for a predefined period of time in exchange for CKTON in return. Basically binding 10,000 CRAB for 12 months can generate 1 CKTON.
