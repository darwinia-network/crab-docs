You will need to unstake your KSM tokens prior to bonding them to the crowdloan module. For recently unstaked KSM tokens, Kusama has a delayed exit period (7 days), which serves as cooldown. During this period, you will not be able to transfer your tokens.


## Stop nominating (staking)

1. Open [Polkadot{.js}](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/) and connect to the Kusama network. Then in the navigation bar at the top of the page, click on "Network" dropdown and select "Staking".

2. Click on "Account actions" in the white sub-header towards the top of the screen. Then click "Stop" (towards the right of the screen) on the account that you'd like to unstake.

3. Click on "Sign and Submit" in the bottom right corner to authorize the transaction. Your browser extension will prompt you to enter your password and sign the transaction. You have now stopped nominating, but your tokens remain bonded.

4. To unbond your tokens, click the ellipses (three dots) on the right-hand side of the page and click on "Unbond funds".

6. If done successfully, there should be a clock icon next the amount you requested to be unbonded. You can hover over the icon to see how much longer until the tokens are fully unlocked, which is approximately 7 days. Once the 7 days have passed, click on "Withdraw unbonded funds". This will make your KSM transferable. Even though it says "withdraw", they won't be leaving your account.

7. You can return to "My Accounts" and select the dropdown next to balance to see that your KSM is now transferable.
