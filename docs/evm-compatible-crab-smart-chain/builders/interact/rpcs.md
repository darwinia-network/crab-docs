## Compared Ethereum RPCs

### Consensus Related Field

Ethereum uses a consensus protocol named Proof-of-Work (PoW). While CSC uses the Nominated Proof of Stake(NPOS). They are two completely different consensus mechanisms. Consequently, Proof of Work concepts, such as `difficulty`, `uncles`, `hashrate`, generally is not applicable to CSC. For APIs that return value related to Ethereumâ€™s Proof of Work, default value are returned.

### Genesis Block

It is particularly important to note that CSC's genesis block does not start at 0 like Ethereum. It is `4969901`. This means that if you try to query the block history before `4969901` with `eth_getBlockByNumber()` or `eth_getBlockByHash()`, you will get `null`.  This is because the DVM smart contract solution was added in the middle of the Substrate-base Crab chain, there are no Ethereum transactions in the Substrate history blocks and no corresponding Ethereum history blocks generated.

### Ethereum Block Author

The author(miner) of the ethereum block you get from `eth_getBlockByNumber()` or `eth_getBlockByHash()` is the last 20 bytes of the actual substrate block author. It's because the ethereum block is built based on substrate block and who's author is a 32-bytes address. We have to truncate to adapt ethereum block needs. **Please do not tranfer to the ethereum block author, since the private key of this address is unknown.**
