> - Staking is a consensus mechanism based on PoS (Proof of Stake / Proof of Stake). Token holders obtain rewards and benefits through pledge, voting, delegation, and locking.  
> - Before participating in staking, please make sure you have at least **1** Crab address. If you hold more tokens or have higher security requirements, it is recommended to prepare **2** Crab addresses. If there is no address, please refer to: [How to create an account](/tutorials/crab-tut-create-account.md).  
> - A small amount of CRING must be prepared in Crab Network's address as fee.

`Stash account` Account for stashing tokens. Tokens participating in staking will come from this account. The operations of this account are mostly related to changes in stash.

`Controller account`  The controller is the account that will be used to control any nominating or validating actions. Should not match another stash or controller.

 > The `Stash account` and `Controller account` can be set to the same account. If you hold more tokens or have higher security requirements, it is recommended to set up different accounts here.

`Value bonded` The total amount of the stash balance that will be at stake in any forthcoming rounds (should be less than the total amount available).  This part of the tokens will be temporarily bonded. bonding takes 14 days to unbond; you can choose to bond CRING or CKTON.

`Payment destination` The destination account for any payment as either a nominator or validator.

`Bond period` Optional; bond CRING promise for 3-36 months to get additional CKTON rewards. (Promise to lock to accept user terms)

 > If you unlock CRING in advance within the lock limit, you will be charged  a penalty of 3 times the CKTON reward (In the absence of sufficient CKTON, the CRING can not be used for payment of fines).

After filling in the staking parameters, please click `bond` and `submit`
