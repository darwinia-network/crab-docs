## Connect MetaMask

If you already have MetaMask installed, you can easily connect MetaMask to Moonriver:

<div class="button-wrapper">
    <a href="#" class="md-button connectMetaMask" value="moonriver">Connect MetaMask</a>
</div>

!!! note
    MetaMask will popup asking for permission to add Moonriver as a custom network. Once you approve permissions, MetaMask will switch your current network to Moonriver.

If you do not have MetaMask installed, please check out the [Interacting with Moonbeam using MetaMask](/tokens/connect/metamask/) guide.
