Since the DVM and the Ethereum virtual machine are compatible in the underlying specifications, users can use the wallets from the existing Ethereum ecosystem to manage their assets. Here we will introduce how to use Metamask.

### Connect with Metamask

1. Install the Metamask plugin, download and install it yourself. 
2. Add a custom network, here is an example of adding a Pangolin test network, different networks have different configuration parameters.

| ---------| ------------------------------------ | -------| --------|---------- |
| Pangolin | http://pangolin-rpc.darwinia.network | 43     | PRING   | https://pangolin.subscan.io/ |
| Crab     | http://crab-rpc.darwinia.network     | 44     | CRING   | https://crab.subscan.io/      |
